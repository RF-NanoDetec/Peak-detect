# Project Reorganization: Change Log

This document summarizes all the changes made during the reorganization of the Peak Analysis Tool project.

## Project Structure

### ✅ Created organized packages

- `core/`: Core functionality, algorithms, and data structures
- `plotting/`: All visualization and plotting functionality
- `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers
- `config/`: Configuration and environment settings
- `resources/`: Static resources like images
- `ui/`: User interface components

### ✅ New entry points and launchers
